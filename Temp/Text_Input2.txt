Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming 
paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional 
programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its 
comprehensive standard library.[33][34] 
 
Guido van Rossum begin working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC 
programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was 
released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting 
garbage collection, reference count, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a 
major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 
was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-based programming language that is designed to have 
as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming 
language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that 
compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to 
recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java 
virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying system architecture. The syntax of Java is 
similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime 
provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are 
typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the 
most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for 
clientâ€“server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
