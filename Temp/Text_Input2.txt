Two roads diverged in a wood, 
And sorry I could not travel both ways 
And be one traveler, long I stood 
And looked down one as far as I could look 
To where it bent ; 
 
Then took the other, as just as fair, 
And having perhaps a better claim, 
Because it was grassy and wanted wear; 
Though as for that the passing there 
Had worn them really about the same, 
 
And both that evening equally lay 
In leaves no step had trodden black. 
Oh, I kept the first for another day! 
Yet knowing how way leads on to way, 
I doubted if I should ever come back. 
 
I shall be telling this without a sigh 
Somewhere ages and ages hence: 
Two roads diverged in the wood, and Iâ€” 
I took the one less traveled by, 
And that has made all the difference. 
 
This is the end of the sample input file 1.
